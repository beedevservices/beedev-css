        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>After noticing that I used the same naming conventions and some of the basic styles over and over I began to think of a way to make programming easier.  Knowing about bootstrap and frameworks like that but never liking the naming conventions they used I chose to start my own.  It may never get used by anyone but myself or a few handful of other developers that find it but thats ok.  </p>
